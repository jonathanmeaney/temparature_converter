    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` â€” watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server available to view in the browser at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
